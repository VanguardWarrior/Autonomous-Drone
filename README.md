# Autonomous Drone  


This project involves developing an **Autonomous Drone** capable of **real-time obstacle detection, path planning, and navigation** using AI and computer vision. The drone is designed to operate independently without manual control, making it useful for applications such as surveillance, search and rescue, and package delivery.  


Features  
✅ Autonomous Navigation – Detects obstacles and adjusts its path accordingly  
✅ Object Recognition – Identifies objects using YOLOv8  
✅ GPS-Based Waypoint Navigation – Moves between predefined GPS coordinates
